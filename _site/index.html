			<h2>Goal</h2>
			<p>GLUE is a design language and a system that was created with the following goals in mind.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Strengthen and unify the OLX brand</strong> across different products to make sure that the OLX brand is consistently communicated no matter where you go.</li>
				<li><strong>Help Designers and Developers</strong> working on the product to innovate and creating new better experiences by reducing repetitive work.</li>
				<li><strong>Create a singular language that would help onboard designers and developers</strong> to get them hitting the ground running and designing as fast as they could.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>GLUE also known as the Global Language for User Experiences is an effort by the global design team to create a unified design language that can be adapted for the different products of OLX across different regions.</p>
		</div>

	<section class="design-principles">
		<div class="small-12 medium-8 large-8 medium-centered large-centered columns mvl">
			<h2>Design Principles</h2>
			<p>Systems embody the principles of those who designed them. GLUE is not meant to be an exhaustive list of every pattern we will ever need and therefore it is important for us to align to these principles as they serve as a measure for every feature, pattern or visual we will ever need.</p>
			<h3>Empathic over smart-ass</h3>
			<p>Better than knowing about the users is to understand them. Don’t design for what you know about the user’s or the business case, design with the user’s and the business shoes on instead. Design within their context and understanding their needs.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Design with the user’s context in mind.</strong> Whether they have poor mobile internet, in a not-so-great neighbourhood to meet someone, in the middle of their commute, if they are at home or multi-tasking in a noisy place, we should always put the context.</li>
				<li><strong>When in doubt, talk to them and get why they do what they do.</strong> User research and testing are our best tools to understand the user’s context and their reasoning behind their behavior, whenever in doubt test and observe.</li>
				<li><strong>The business is also a user.</strong> Remember that great ux is not only for our main users but the business itself is also a user, understand the business context and design accordingly.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Clear for the user over clear for us</h3>
			<p>Avoid ambiguity or product complexity that could serve best the business, tech or product in the short term. Instead enable people to understand clearly, and simply choose and act with confidence in each point. They will reach the next ones ready to start from the best place: a great previous experience.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Avoid clutter by designing with the <strong>minimum visible stimuli</strong>. Every interaction and pattern should be built to clearly show it's hierarchy over (or below) other elements, so it harmonizes with other elements instead of competing for attention with any other element in the system.</li>
				<li>Avoid the upper hub: Use the right moment, not the easiest place…</li>
				<li>Don’t forget the OKRs context when measuring the solution: Ex.: long term effect in activity for an instant conversion pusher.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Evolving over finalised</h3>
			<p>The content on OLX should be anti-fragile, improving with use and evolving overtime. We did not want to design printed books for the internet.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>We keep our design system neat and documented to make sure it is easily updatable and understandable for our designers and developers.</li>
					<li>We keep track of our changes and understand the need for each change and make sure that is communicated properly within the system.</li>
				</ol>
			<h3>Delightful over just good enough</h3>
			<p>Solve people’s issues with respect and care for the amount and the quality of the time they spent on our product. Capitalize that time for them, make them feel cared and living a unique, crafted experience hosted for them. Make them come back.</p>
